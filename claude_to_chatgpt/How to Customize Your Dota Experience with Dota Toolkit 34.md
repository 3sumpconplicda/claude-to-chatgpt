## What is Dota Toolkit 3.4?
 
Dota Toolkit 3.4 is a free software that contains a wide range of features and functions to improve your Dota experience. Some of the main features are:
 
- **Reassign keys**: You can change the default keys for your inventory, skills, mouse buttons, and even Invoker's spells. You can use any combination of keys that suits your playstyle, such as spacebar, shift, alt + key, etc.
- **Customize skills**: You can replace the classic keys for hero skills with the QWER layout, which is more convenient and intuitive for most players. This feature is especially useful for new players who have trouble memorizing all the hotkeys for over 100 heroes.
- **Generate customkeys**: You can create a customkeys.txt file in seconds from the "Customkeys" tab. This file allows you to set your preferred keys for the main actions of units and hero abilities. This feature is essential for heroes with more than 4 skills, such as Rubick, Invoker, Io. The same key layout will also apply to buying items in the secret shop and the goblin market.
- **Quick messages**: You can access the "Quick" tab to save time by typing common messages in the chat, such as "Missing enemy in my lane", "No mana", "I'm using the courier". You can set a group of predefined messages to use them during the game with just a press of a key combination.
- **And much more**: You can also change the screen resolution of the game, set the keyboard language, lock the Windows button to avoid minimizing the game accidentally, enable health bars for units, change directional keys, and more.
